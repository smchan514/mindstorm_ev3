> The cable connectors in the NXT sets and EV3 sets are the same, so that many of the EV3 and NXT devices can be 
> used together. Some combinations are compatible, others are not, as discussed in the next. You can see a 
> demonstration of two possible configurations in the following video.

> You can connect all official LEGO NXT motors and official LEGO NXT sensors to the EV3 brick. For example, you can 
> have a configuration with an NXT Touch Sensor, an EV3 Touch Sensor, an NXT motor and a Medium EV3 motor, all 
> connected to the EV3 brick, as shown in Figure 4. You use the NXT devices in the EV3 software as if they are EV3 
> components, as demonstrated in the video.
